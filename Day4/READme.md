While working on the project I have created four html files such as
1.Project0.html:
    In this file I have written about my msit journey, courses offered, Groups in Msit , my experience on the courses. And I have linked project0.css file to it which contains some styles such as color,background-color, font-size, text-style etc,. I also added lists,button and Input text box to take the review of my web page using data list. In addition to it I used some scss methods like nesting and variables
2.File1.html:
    In this file I wrote about me and I have applied bootstrap grid method in this to show my pic and text about me side by side.
3.File2.html:
    In this file I wrote about my educational qualifications and I have used some css attributes too.
4.File3.html:
    In this file I have used scss Inheritance technique to describe more about me.

In the above stated file I haved connected one to another in the above order.
I have used every concept which are mentioned in project description. To deal with scss files I have installed Ruby and Sass to convert scss file to css file automatically.
